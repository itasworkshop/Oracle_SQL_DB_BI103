PL/SQL --> Procedural Language SQL

procedural -
step by step execution/flow of program/query
compiled language

exemples: - if-else, loops, variables, begin-end, UDF, Functions/procedures

stored procedure --> pre parsed query
like functions , takes some input, perform calculation, may or may not result

Advantages of PL/SQL
These are the advantages of PL/SQL.
Block Structures: PL SQL consists of blocks of code, which can be nested within each other. Each block forms a unit of a task or a logical module. PL/SQL Blocks can be stored in the database and reused.
Procedural Language Capability: PL SQL consists of procedural language constructs such as conditional statements (if else statements) and loops like (FOR loops).
Better Performance: PL SQL engine processes multiple SQL statements simultaneously as a single block, thereby reducing network traffic.
Error Handling: PL/SQL handles errors or exceptions effectively during the execution of a PL/SQL program. Once an exception is caught, specific actions can be taken depending upon the type of the exception or it can be displayed to the user with a message.

1) Minimum PL/SQL block
hello world in plsql

SQL> begin
  2  dbms_output.put_line('Hello World!');
  3  end;
  4
  5  /

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

SQL> set serveroutput on;
SQL> /
Hello World!

PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

2) block with variables
DECLARE
	name varcher2(20) := 'Ravi Kishan';
BEGIN
	dbms_output.put_line('Hello ',name);
END;
